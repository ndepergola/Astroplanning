# Astroplanning
Planning an observing schedule using the Python packages astroplan and astropy. 
Program extracts data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to obtain the orbital motions of 3 objects, and astroplan allows us to create a detailed schedule of the best times to observe the objects in one night.
